# MCP Demo Project

A minimal Agent → Broker → Tool system implementing a basic MCP-style message flow.

## Files
- tool.js: executes operations
- broker.js: routes MCP requests to tools
- agent.js: sends formatted MCP requests
- schema.md: protocol message shapes
- NOTES.md: conceptual notes

This project is built step-by-step across MCP learning blocks.
